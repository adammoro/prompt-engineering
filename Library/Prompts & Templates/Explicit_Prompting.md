# Explicit Prompting #

Crafting prompts in a way that helps guide an AI language model, like ChatGPT, is how to get them to provide more accurate, relevant, and useful responses. Here are some tips and examples for effective prompting:

1. Be specific and clear: Provide enough context or details to guide the AI toward the desired response.
`Example: "Provide a summary of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26."`

2. Ask for a step-by-step approach: When seeking a process or method, request step-by-step instructions.
`Example: "Explain the step-by-step process of setting up a Google Ads campaign."`

3. Request a particular format: Specify the format you want the response to be in, such as a list or comparison.
`Example: "List the top 5 differences between electric cars and traditional gasoline-powered vehicles."`

4. Provide constraints: Limit the scope of the answer by setting constraints, like time, geography, or context.
`Example: "Describe the economic situation in the United States during the Great Depression of the 1930s."`

5. Use the "In the style of" approach: Request that the response is written in a particular style or tone.
`Example: "Explain quantum physics in the style of a Dr. Seuss poem."`

6. Debias the response: Explicitly ask the AI to consider different perspectives or avoid favoring one side.
`Example: "What are the arguments for and against implementing a Universal Basic Income policy?"`

7. Request sources or citations: Ask for source recommendations to support the provided information.
`Example: "Which research papers should I read to understand the impact of AI on the job market?"`

Remember that AI models like ChatGPT can be sensitive to the phrasing and structure of prompts. Experiment with different prompt formulations to achieve the desired response.

## Prompt ##

Here's a prompt template that takes the tips above into account.

```
"[Specific context] In the context of [topic or subject], please provide a [format: summary/list/comparison] of the [main aspect] while considering [constraints, if any]. Be sure to address [different perspectives/debiasing], and present the information in the style of [desired style/tone]. Finally, include relevant sources or citations to support the information."
```

### Example Usage ###

You can customize this template by filling in the relevant details for your specific question or topic. Here's an example of a customized prompt:

```
"In the context of renewable energy sources, please provide a comparison of the top 3 technologies, namely solar, wind, and hydropower, while considering their environmental impact and cost-effectiveness. Be sure to address the arguments for and against each technology, and present the information in a concise and objective manner. Finally, include relevant sources or citations to support the information."

This prompt is specific, clear, requests a particular format, provides constraints, asks for debiasing, sets a desired style, and asks for sources. Adjusting the template to fit your needs can help guide ChatGPT to provide more accurate and relevant responses.
